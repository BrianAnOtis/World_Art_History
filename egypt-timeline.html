					<div class="time">Neolithic in Egypt: Prehistoric Cultures of Lower Egypt</div>
					<p>
						Cultural development is very closely linked to geographical and ecological
						conditions, and Egypt provides a perfect example of that link. In seeking
						the prehistoric roots of Egyptian culture, we must also examine the changes
						in its geographical setting. The climate was subject to great variation. Two
						factors should be taken into consideration: rainfall and the inundation of
						the Nile. While the latter influenced living conditions in the valley
						iteself, the former decided whether the bordering desert regions were
						habitable or not, thus determining the relationship of the Nile Valley to
						its surroundings, and the relations of its inhabitants with their neighbors.
						Finds of

						provide evidence of human life in the Nile Valley going back to the Early
						Paleolithic. However, it is impossible to discern any characteristics
						specific to Egypt as a cultural area at this time. Those characteristics
						emerge only in the Late Paleolithic, somewhere between 25,000 and 10,000
						BCE. During this period a phase of extreme drought drove the early human
						groups out of the savannas of the Sahara, where they had led a nomadic life
						as hunter-gatherers, and into the valley of the Nile. The Nile was still a
						small river at this time, probably containing water in its bed seasonally,
						but it offered substinance. Within this context, developments of great
						significance began to occur. The stone tools, predominently small blades and

						, do not look impressive at first sight. However, they were used to give a
						sharp edge or point to composite tools like knives, arrow-heads, spears,
						fishhooks, and harpoons, which represent enormous technical progress. The
						remnants of food found in sites show that provisions such as fish were
						already being dried and stored to tide people over the months of scarcity.
						The increasing number of sites over the course of time also shows that a
						semi-settled way of life made population growth possible. Merimda Beni
						Salama, probably the oldest truly Neolithic Egyptian site, is situated in
						Lower Egypt on the western border of the Nile Delta and, at its southern
						extremity, about 50 km northwest of Cairo. Recent excavations of this
						extensive site have identified five archaeological phases, the oldest of
						which probably goes back to the sixth millennium BCE, while the later phases
						cover most of the fifth millennium BCE. The oldest cultural level of Merimda
						clearly shows independent features. In the excavator's opinion, the fishbone
						patterns incised into plates, dishes, and deep bowls of beautiful, fine,
						polished or burnished pottery indicate contact with the Near East, as do the
						arrowheads. On the second cultural level, however, there is also evidence of
						contact with the south, in the shape of bone harpoons and axes of Nubian
						stone: a warning that the background of the Delta's prehistoric cultures
						should not be sought exclusively in the Near East. In Upper Egypt, the
						oldest truly Neolithic cultural group is represented by a series of
						settlement sites and cemeteries on the east bank of the Nile, near the
						village of Badari, south of Asiut. Chronologically, the early stages of this
						culture overlap the end of the Merimda culture in the north, about 4400 BCE,
						and it coincides with the beginning of the Naqada culture in the early
						fourth millennium, around 3800 BCE. The Badarian culture was succeeded by
						the Naqada culture, the most important prehistoric culture of Upper Egypt.
						Its development can be traced without a break to the founding of the
						Egyptian state. Divided into three mina phases (Naqada I-III), each with
						several subdivisions, it provides a line along which the technological,
						social, and poltical progress of the Predynastic Period can be clearly
						traced. At the beginning of the fourth millennium the oldest phase, Naqada I
						(also known as Amratian) initially ran parallel to the Badarian culture,
						which was geographically next door to it, gradually superimposing itself and
						finally replacing it.

						is a special feature of the Naqada I culture. At first, the patterns were
						geometrical, but they can sometimes be interpreted as stylized floral
						motifs. In the later Naqada period, however, they have figure decoration
						most frequently showing animals, particularly those of the Nile Valley such
						as hippopotamuses and crocodiles. Now and then the decoration consists of
						scenic compositions with human figures, and these are clearly pictures of
						hunts, sometimes perhaps scenes of worship or of battle.

					<p>
						Also known as the Egyptian Archaic Period, any discussion of this issue must
						revolve arounf the term "unification." The land of Egypt was regarded as
						made up of two linked halves, Upper and Lower Egypt, adn the pharaonic
						kingship as a double institution: the Pharaoh ruled both parts of the
						country. Every ruler had to perform anew the ritual of the "unification of
						the two lands" on ascending the throne. This pattern of geographical dualism
						permeates Egyptian thinking. Crowns, architectural forms, emblematic plants
						and divinities were symmertrically allotted to the two parts of the country.
						With the founding of the unified Egyptian state, the monarchy had also
						acquired a new dimension, and a new character in its socio-political role.
						These are most closely reflected in the development of royal tomb
						architecture, which can be traced in the

						until the end of the First Dynasty. The necropolis lies in the desert area,
						some 1.5 km away from the strip of fertile land. Its tombs are rectangular
						chambers sunk into the desert soil and shored up on the outside by brick
						walls. The first stage of development came with Horus Aha. His tomb, instead
						of having two chambers sunk side by side, as in the case of three previous
						tombs from "Dynasty 0," comprised three considerably large chambers. In
						addition, his tomb shows the first evidence of a custom that flourished
						intensively for a short time, and then fell into disuse at the end of the
						First Dynasty: the custom of burying members of the royal household in
						neighboring tombs. The finds on the site as a whole make it hard to avoid
						concluding that the people buried here were in fact killed on the occasion
						of the royal funeral. Stelae referring to such tombs mention servants,
						including people of small stature ("dwarfs"), who were popular as part of a
						rotal household, and women and dogs. In the case of Aha, thiry-six secondary
						tombs were laid out in three parallel rows. Investigations of bones cast
						aside by earlier excavators as worthless recently produced some results as
						surprising as they were revealing. King Aha had also taken a group of young
						lions into the next world with him as a symbol of royalty. Judging by the
						state of their bones, the animals had lived and were probably even born in
						captivity; in other words, the royal court kept lions.

						2686 to 2160 BCE: Old Kingdom (Third to Eighth Dynasties)
					</div>
					<p>
						At the end of the Thinite Period (the First and Second Dynasties), which
						concluded the early history of Egypt, the country's political and economic
						center was finally fixed in the Memphis area. The distinguishing outward
						mark of the Old Kingdom (Third to Sixth Dynasties) consists of the gigantic
						pyramid tombs of its kings, appearing to defy time and decay. To this extent
						the reign of Djoser marks an important watershed, the start of a magical
						period, in which Egypt emerges from its dark early history, and the
						brilliance of the Old Kingdon begins: the Age of the Pyramids. This is how
						the Egyptians themselves saw it, and in Djoser's reign they recognized a
						real beginning, a new era, although the ancient Egyptian view of life was in
						fact cyclical rather than historical. It was seen as a succession of
						recurring events, as in nature, structured by annual festivals and the royal
						jubilees. Rough blocks of stone were occasionally employed in and on tombs
						of the Archaic Period, but Djoser and Imhotep discovered worked stone as a
						building material and with it created the first monumental architecture,
						buildings whose forms and symbols gave shape to the state of Egypt. In the
						stone buildings and courts, which were now "everlasting" thanks to the
						material, the idea was that the deified king should continue to celebrate,
						as was his lifetime role as ruler, the tiruals and cult practices that
						ensured the presercation of the world order established by the gods. With
						death and deification this became his eternal task. Each king therefore had
						to construct his own tomb precinct and his own pyramid as palace for the
						next world, and as representation of the eternal Egypt of the afterlife.
						This remarkable representation in stone of a state philosophy did not come
						about suddenly or arise out of nothing. By the reign of Djoser, Egypt had
						existed as a single country for several hundred years. With unification the
						old nomadic ways of the leading Upper Egyptian tribes of the First Dynasty
						were intermingled with the more settled, architectural culture of the
						peoples of the Delta region. Before

							>Djoser's mortuary complex</a
						>
						there were differences in use of space between the Upper Egyptian royal
						tombs of Abydos and those in the Lower Egyptian royal cemetery. Djoser took
						forms that had developed in the separate regions through geographical and
						cultural differences, and combined them harmoniously in one complex and in a
						single tomb building. Superficially, it was dominated by the form and
						arrangement of palace tombs of the "Buto-type" mastaba. Thus far, scholars
						have sought to explain the origins of the Djoser precinct by a very abstract
						concept, namely as a construction that combines the two types that had
						existed alongside one another in Abydos for generations: the valley complex
						and the so-called tumuli of Abydos. However, since it became known that the
						Abydos royal tombs were not in fact burial mounds of any substantial height,
						but were covered by no more than a rather unattractive sand bank barely
						rising above the desert, this theory has become distinctly questionable. Far
						more likely is that in the construction of the Djoser complex, nearby tomb
						buildings in the royal cemetery of Saqqara, the "Buto-type" mastabas of the
						First and Second Dynasties, were used as a model. Although we know little
						about the character of Djoser from comtemporary sources it seems neverthless
						possible that he was responsible for the innovative conecpt of royal palace
						for the afterlife. Subsequent successors of Djoser, like the son of Snefru
						(founding pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty), benefited from the previous
						examples in order to plan an even more ambitious pyramid for his tomb. In
						order to avoid other ruined buildings that came before him, he settled on a
						solid rock foundation, which he found in a commanding position on the ridge
						above what is now

						. The new royal palace was erected to the east. The perfection of the
						proportions and construction of the superstructure exactly matches the
						planning of the system of corridors and chambers inside. To the present day,
						scholars have tried in a broadly positive spirit to attribute the pyramid's
						three chambers to three successive changes in the design. But it does not do
						justice to the architects who designed and executed this unique building so
						perfectly to suggest that, in the essential element of the pyramid's
						construction, that is the system of tomb chambers, they had proceeded
						without concept or design

						2030 to 1650 BC: Middle Kingdom (Eleventh Dynasty to Thirteenth Dynasty)
					</div>
					<p>
						The Old Kingdom came to an end when a member of the house of Khety of
						Herakleopolis took over the Memphite throne under circumstances that are as
						yet unknown. The usual designation for the period to follow, the "First
						Intermediate Period," refers to a short phase of conflicts between the south
						and the north for dominance of the country. The new dynasty of the
						Herakleopolitans (Ninth/Tenth Dynasties) was only recognized from Lower
						Egypt to the area south of Asuit. Thebes was hostile from the outset. There
						the ruler of the city had overcome his opponents in the south. With the help
						of Nubian mercenaries and during the course of extended fighting, the
						Thebans succeeded in overpowering the Middle Egyptian blockade at Asiut.

						Kingdom. The victorious dynasty developed Thebes as its capital. Just at the
						moment of the new unification of the realm under Mentuhotep II, however, the
						provincial rulers, the so-called nomarchs gained strength, to judge from the
						authoritarian tone of their tomb inscriptions. This is a possible indication
						that Mentuhotep II had to show them his gratitude in exchange for being
						accepted as king in Memphis.

						1520 to 1075 BCE: New Kingdom (Eighteenth to Twentieth Dynasties)
					</div>
					<p>
						The New Kingdom presents itself to the modern observer as the period in
						which Egypt achieved its greatest territorial expansion and produced its
						most famous royal personalities. Its starting point, however, is the revolt
						of the Thebans in Upper Egypt against the Hyksos whose stronghold was based
						in Lower Egypt. By about 1570 BCE the Hyksos ruler controlled only the
						northern part of the country from his capital of Avaris in the Delta. The
						first attack by the Thebans under
						<a

						>
						, who had previously already conquered the Hyksos followers in Middle Egypt,
						had been repelled. The Hyksos king now tried in vain to establish contact
						with the ruler of the Nubian kingdom of Kerma in order to engage Thebes on
						two fronts. His messenger was captured on the oasis road. The second attack
						under the future Theban ruler Ahmose was more successful. Memphis was
						captured, and the Theban fleet appeared before Avaris. Finally, the city
						surrendered. Ahmose took over the citadel fo the city, which he then
						extended and decorated with Minoan frescoes among other motifs. The main
						force of the Hyksos had withdrawn to the southern Palestinian town of
						Sharuhen, After a three-year siege, this bastion also fell and the region
						came once more under Egyptian influence. For historians, the expulsion of
						the Hyksos and the reunification of the Kingdom under Ahmose marks the
						beginning of the so-called New Kingdom. The political history of the first
						half of the New Kingdom is marked by gradual territorial expansion into Asia
						Minor and Nubia. The borders of Egypt were redefined. At the end of the
						campaigns of conquest, the southern border was situated deep in what is now
						Sudan near Abu Hamid, north of the fifth cataract, while the northern border
						presumably extended as far as the Euphrates to a country called Naharin.
						Egypt rose to become a "world power." However, the territory beyond the Nile
						valley was hardly controlled to its full extent. Although the larger and
						smaller city states of Palestine were controlled by Egyptian "advisers,"
						they were left under the rule of the local princes. This can at best be
						described as imperialism geared to the exploitation of raw materials and the
						control of trade routes. There is a vast discrepancy between the
						contemporary claim in the ancient sources that Egypt ruled the world "as far
						as its outer edges" and the actual extent of Egyptian power, Egypt never
						succeeded in permanently pacifying central and northern Syria. The pharoahs
						were in competition there with the princes of other large states beyond the
						Euphrates, and then with the Hittites. Nontheless, Egypt achieved a position
						of power in the Mediterranean region and remarkable cultural dynamism as a
						result of its foreign policy successes and internal political stability.
