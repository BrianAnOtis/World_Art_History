					<p>
						Althought the Greeks borrowed many ideas from the artists and architects of
						Egypt and Mesopotamia. they quickly developed an independent artistic
						identity. Their many innovations in painting, sculpture, and architecture
						became the foundation of the Western tradition in the history of art.
						Indeed, no building type has ever had a longer and more profound impact on
						the later history of architecture than the Greek temple, which was itself a
						multimedia monument, richly adorned with painted statues and reliefs.

						made up of two schematic figures locked in a hand-to-hand struggle. The man
						is a hero, probably Herakles. His opponent is a centaur, possibly Nessos,
						who had volunteered to carry the hero's bride across a river and then
						assulted her. Composite monsters were enormously popular in Mesopotamia and
						Egypt, and renewed contact with foreign cultures may have inspired the
						human-animal monsters of Geometric Greece. The centaur, however, is a purely
						Greek invention

					<div class="time">700 to 680 BCE: Orientalizing Art Period</div>
					<p>
						During the seventh-century BCE, the pace and scope of Greek trade and
						colonization accelerated and Greek artists became exposed more than even
						before to Eastern artworks, especially small portable objects such as
						<a

							>Syrian ivory carvings</a
						>. The closer contact had a profound effect on the development of Greek art.
						Indeed, so many motifs borrowed from or inspired by Egyptian and
						Mesopotamian art entered the Greej pictorial vocabulary at this time that
						art historians have dubbed the seventh-century BCE the Orientalizing period.
						One of the masterworks of the early seventh century BCE is the Mantiklos
						Apollo, a small bronze statuette dedicated to Apollo by the otherwise
						unknown man named Mantiklos. Scratched into the thighs of the figure is a
						message to the deity: "Mantiklos dedicated me as the tithe to the
						far-shooting Lord of the Silver Bow; you, Phoibos [Apollo]; might give me
						some pleasing favor in return." What is apprent here is the increased
						interest Greek artists at this time had in reproducing details of the human
						anatomy, such as the pectoral and abdominal muscles, which define the
						stylized triangular torso. The sculptor also took care to represent the long
						hair framing the unnaturally elongated neck. The triangular face once had
						inlaid eyes, and the figure may have worn a separately fashioned helmet. The
						elaborate

						typifies the new Greek fascination with the Orient. In a series of bands
						recalling the organization of Geometric painted vases, animals such as the
						native boar appear beside exotic lions and panthers and composite creatures
						inspired by Eastern monsters such as the sphinx and lamassu prominently
						displayed on the amphora's neck. The Orientalizing animal freezes of these
						vases had wide appeal in the marketplace, but so too did the new ceramic
						technique the Corinthians invented. Art historians call this type of vase
						decoration black-figure painting. The black figure painter first put down
						black silhouette on the clay surface, as in Geometric times, but then used a
						sharp, pointed instrument to incise linear details within the forms, usually
						adding highlights in white or purplish red over the black figures before
						firing the vase. The combination of the weighty black silhouettes with the
						delicate detailing and the bright polychrome overlay proved to be
						irresistable, and Athenian painters soon copied the technique that the
						Corinthians pioneered.

					<div class="time">600 to 480 BCE: Archaic Period</div>
					<p>
						The legend that Daedalus worked in Egypt reflects the enormous influence of
						Egyptian art and architecture on the Greeks not only during the
						Orientalizing age of the seventh-century BCE but also in the succeeding
						Archaic period, which lasted from 600 to 480 BCE. According to the
						first-century BCE Greek historian Dindorus Siculus, Daedalus used the same
						compositional patterns for his statues as the Egyptians used for their own.
						The earliest surviving large-scale stone statues of the Greeks do, in fact,
						follow very closely the standard Egyptian format. One of the earliest Greek
						examples of life-size statuary is the marble

						("youth";plural, kouroi) now in New York, which emulates the stance of
						Egyptian statues. In both Egypt and Greece, the figure is rigidly frontal
						with the left foot advanced slightly. The arms are held beside the body, and
						the fists are clenched with the thumbs forward. As did most Egyptian
						statues, the New York kouros also had a funerary function. It stood over a
						grave in the countryside of Attica, the region around Athens, possibly in
						the same cemetery as the later statue of

						>
						Kroisos. Statues such as this one replaced the huge vases of Geometric times
						as the preferred form of grave marker in the sixth-century BCE. The Greeks
						also used kouroi as votive offerings in sanctuaries. The kouros type,
						because of its generic quality, could be employed in several different
						contexts.

						circa 500 BCE: Aegina and the Transition to the Classic Period
					</div>
					<p>
						The years just before and after 500 BCE were also a time of dynamic
						transition in architecture and architectural sculpture. Some of the changes
						were evolutionary in nature, others revolutionary. Both kinds are evident in
						the Doric temple at Aegina dedicated to Aphaia, a local nymph.

						, even though the ratio of width to lenght is similar. Doric architects had
						learned a great deal in the half-century that elapsed between the
						construction of the two temples. The columns of the Aegina temple are more
						widely spaced and more slender. The capitals create a smooth transition from
						the vertical shafts below to the horizontal architrave above. Gone are the
						Archaic flattened echinuses and bulging shafts of the Paestum columns. The

					<div class="time">circa 480 BCE: Early and High Classical Periods</div>
					<p>
						Art histoirans date the beginning of the Classical age from a historical
						event: the defeat of the Persian invaders by the allied Hellenic
						city-states. Historians universally consider the decades following the
						removal of the Persian threat the high point of Greek civilization. This is
						the era of the dramatists Sophocles and Euripides, as well as Aeschylus; the
						historian Herodotusl the statesman Periclesl the philosopher Socrates; and
						many of the most famous Greek architects, sculptors, and painters. The first
						great monument of Classical art and architecture is the Temple of Zeus at
						Olympia, site of the Olympic Games. The architect was LIBON OF ELIS, who
						began work on the temple about 470 BCE and completed it by 457 BCE. Today
						the structure is in ruins, its picturesque yumbled aolumn drums an eloquent
						reminder of the effect of the passage of time on even the grandest monuments
						humans have built. A good idea of its original appearance can be gleaned,
						however, from a slightly later

						>
						; an even number of columns (six) on the short ends, two columns in antis,
						and two rows of columns in two stories inside the cella. But the Temple of
						Zeus was more lavishly decorated than even the Aphaia temple. Statues filled
						both pediments, and narrative reliefs adorned the sic metopes over the
						doorway in the pronaos and the matching six of the opisthodomos. The
						hallmark of Early Classical statuary is the abandonment of the rigid and
						unnatural Egyptian-inspired pose of the Archaic statues. The figures in the
						Olympia pediments exemplify this radical break with earlier practice, but
						the change occured even earlier at the very moment Greece was under attack
						by the Persians. Although it is well under life-size, the marble statue
						known at the

						is one of the most important statues in the history of art. Never before had

						or their Egyptian predecessors. Humans shift their weight and the position
						of the torso around the vertical axis of the spine. The sculptor of the
						Kritios Boy was the first, or one of the first, to grasp this anatomical
						fact and to represent it in statuary.

					<div class="time">circa 350 BCE: Late Classical Period</div>
					<p>
						The Peloponnesian War, which began in 431 BCE, ended in 404 BCE with the
						complete defeat of the plague-weakened Athens. The victor, Sparta, and then
						Thebes undertook the leadership of Greece, both unsuccessfully. In the
						middle of the fourth century BCE, a threat from without caused the rival
						Greek states to put aside their disagreements and unite for their common
						defense, as they had earlier against the Persians. But at the battle of
						Chaeronea in 338 BCE, the Greek cities suffered a devastating loss and had
						to give up their independence to the Macedonian king, Philip II. Philip was
						assassinated in 336, and his sons, Alecander III, better known as simply
						Alexander the Great, succeeded him. Alexander led a powerful Empire, wrested
						control of Egypt, and even reached India. The fourth century BCE in Greece
						was thus a time of political upheaval, which had a profound impact on the
						psyche of the Greeks and on the art they produced. In the fifth century BCE,
						Greeks had generally believed that rational human beings could impose order
						on their environment, create "perfect" statues such as the

						>
						. The Parthenon frieze celebrated the Athenians as a community of the
						citizens with shared values. The Peloponnesian War and the unceasing strife
						of the fourth century BCE brought an end to the serene idealism of the
						previous century. Disillusionment and alieanation followed. Greek thought
						and Greed art began to focus more on the individual and on the real world
						appearances instead of on the community and the ideal world of perfect
						beings and perfect shrines. The new approach to art is immediately apparent
						in the work of PRAXITELES, one of the three greatest sculptors of the
						fourth-century BCE. Praxiteles did not reject the favored statuary themes of
						the High Classical period, and his Olympian gods and goddesses retained
						their superhuman beauty. But in his hands, those deities lost some of their
						solemn grandeur and took on a worldly sensuousness. Nowhere is this new
						humanizing spirit more evident than in the

						that Praxiteles sold to the Knidians after another city had rejected it. The
						lost original, carved from Parian marble, known only through copies of Roman
						date, but Pliny considered it "superior to all the works, not only of
						Praxiteles, but indeed in the whole world." It made Knidos famous, and many
						people sailed there just to see the statue in its round temple, where "it
						was possible to view the image of the goddess from every side." According to
						Pliny, some visitors were "overcome with love for the statue." The Aphrodite
						of Knidos caused a sensation in its time because Praxiteles took the
						unprecedented step of representing the goddess of love completely nude.
						Female nudity was rare in earlier Greek art and had been confined almost
						exclusively to paintings on vases designed for symposia and household use.
						The women so depicted also were usually not noblewomen or goddesses but
						courtesans or slave girls.

					<div class="time">323 to 30 BCE: Hellenistic Period</div>
					<p>
						Alexander the Great's conquest of Mesopotamia and Egypt ushered in a new
						cultural age that historians and art historians alike call Hellenistic. The
						Hellenistic period opened with the death of Alexander in 323 BCE and lasted
						nearly three centuries, until the double suicide of Queen Cleopatra of Egypt
						and her Roman consort, Mark Anthony, in 30 BCE after their decisive defeat
						at the battle of Actium, by Anthony's rival Augustus. That year, Augustus
						made Egypt a province of the Roman Empire. The cultural centers of the
						Hellenistic period were the court cities of the Greek kings who succeeded
						Alexander and divided his far-flung empire among themselves. The greater
						variety, and sophistication of Hellenistic culture called for an
						architecture on a grandios scale and of wide diversity, something far beyonf
						the requirements of the Classical polis, even beyond that of AThens at the
						height of its power. Building activity shifted from the old centers on the
						Greek mainland to the opulent cities of the Hellenistic monarchs in the
						East. Great scale, a theatrical element of surprise, and a willingness to
						break traditional rules of Greek temple design characterize one of the most
						ambitious projects of the Hellenistic period, the Temple of Apollo at
						Didyma. The Hellenistic temple replaced the Archaic temple at the site the
						Persians burned in 494 BCE when they sacked nearby Miletos. Construction
						began around 300 BCE under the direction of two architects native to the
						area, PAIONIOS OF EPHESOS and DAPHNIS OF MILETOS. So vast was the
						undertaking, however, that work on the temple continues off and on for more
						than 500 years, and still the project was never completed. Although
						Hellenistic architects and sculptors tackled an expanded range of subjects,
						they did not abandon tracitional themes, such as the Greek athlete.
						Nevertheless, they often treated the old subjects in novel ways. This is
						certainly true of the magnificent
